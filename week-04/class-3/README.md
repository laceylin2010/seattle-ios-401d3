#Week 4 - Class 3 
##Homework
* Create a table view in HomeViewController and populate it with repositories.
* Create ProfileViewController that will display User information. Build the UI similar to how it looks on Github.
* Implement a UISearchBar on your repo search view controller and modify your repo search fetch method on your network controller to use the search bar’s text. Be sure to only be making authenticated network calls using your oath token!
* **Code Challenge:** 
	* Given a non-negative number "num", return true if num is within 2 of a multiple of 10. Note: `(a % b)` is the remainder of dividing a by b, so `(7 % 5)` is 2
* **Bonus:**
